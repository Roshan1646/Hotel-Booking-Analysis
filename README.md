# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

The Hotel Booking Analysis project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing hotel booking information. The dataset includes details such as guest demographics, booking patterns, length of stay, market segments, room types, cancellations, revenue generation, and more. The goal is to understand guest behavior, identify trends, optimize revenue, and improve overall hotel management strategies.
## Objectives:

# Booking Patterns: Analyze the distribution of booking dates (arrival_date_week_number and arrival_date_day_of_month) to identify booking trends and peak seasons. Understand which months or days are most popular for bookings.

#Length of Stay: Examine the distribution of stays_in_weekend_nights and stays_in_week_nights to understand how long guests typically stay. Identify patterns for different types of guests.

#Guest Demographics: Explore the distribution of adults, children, and babies to gain insights into the composition of guests. Understand the guest profile and their preferences.

#Meal Preferences: Analyze text_formatmeal to understand popular meal choices among guests (e.g., room-only, bed and breakfast, half-board, full-board). Determine which meal plans attract more bookings.

#Market Segments: Study text_formatmarket_segment to identify different market segments and their contribution to bookings. Understand which segments are the most significant for the hotel.

#Distribution Channels: Examine text_formatdistribution_channel to understand which channels bring in the most bookings (e.g., online travel agencies, direct bookings, travel agents). Evaluate the effectiveness of different booking channels.

#Repeated Guests: Analyze the is_repeated_guest column to identify the number and behavior of returning guests. Understand guest loyalty and retention.

#Cancellations: Study previous_cancellations and previous_bookings_not_canceled to understand the cancellation rate and history of guests. Identify reasons for cancellations and their impact on revenue.

#Room Type: Examine text_formatreserved_room_type and text_formatassigned_room_type to identify popular room choices and any upgrade/downgrade patterns. Optimize room allocation strategies.

#Deposit Type: Analyze text_formatdeposit_type to understand the preferred deposit type chosen by guests (e.g., non-refundable, refundable). Assess the impact of deposit choices on booking behavior.

#Agent and Company Influence: Explore text_formatagent and text_formatcompany to identify any particular agents or companies that contribute significantly to bookings. Strengthen relationships with key partners.

#Waiting List: Examine days_in_waiting_list to understand how long guests are willing to wait for a reservation. Optimize waitlist management.

#Customer Type: Study text_formatcustomer_type to identify different types of customers (e.g., transient, group, contract) and their booking behavior. Customize marketing strategies for different customer segments.

#Average Daily Rate (ADR): Calculate the average daily rate using adr to understand revenue generation. Analyze ADR across different periods and segments.

#Parking Spaces: Analyze required_car_parking_spaces to determine how many guests require parking facilities. Plan parking capacity accordingly.

#Special Requests: Examine total_of_special_requests to understand the demand for additional services or amenities. Improve guest experience by catering to their preferences.

#Reservation Status: Study text_formatreservation_status and calendar_todayreservation_status_date to analyze the booking status over time and the distribution of confirmed, canceled, or modified reservations. Identify patterns in reservation status changes.
